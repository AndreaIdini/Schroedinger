### Guideline for pull requests
* Fork the project
* Create a feature branch using the name convention *feature-dev* (e.g. *basis-dev*)
* Write your code, having patience to document it (comments in code, UML diagrams, examples of use...). This is **very important**!
* Follow the same coding convention used (style, names, ...)
* Implement significant test cases. Make sure that all tests pass.
* Create a pull request, describing what you've done.

### Guideline for maintainers
* Personally check if everything works in the code provided in PRs
* Make sure that all the tests provided pass
* If a feature is completely implemented then merge the feature branch in the *dev* branch.
* If the dev branch is relatively stable, merge it in *master* branch.
* Always look at CircleCI build results after merging / committing.

*Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live*
